## Long-Term Development

1.0 will be the first long-term stable release. The API will be locked until the next major release. New functionality-breaking and/or backwards incompatible changes will be introduced into the master branch.

## Short-Term Development

0.8.0 The first stable release following the migration to GitHub from Google Code.

* The parser is fully featured and mostly bug free
* The TODO list includes re-vamping of the Documentation & examples
* Tests will be revisited and work will be done to add headless browser testing support.
* NPM support will be added
* Hopefully, Bower support can be transferred over from Mirlord and updated to the latest.

## How You Can Help

**Run the test runner:** Just run the **tests** in your particular brand of browser and report any failures.

**We need performance tests:** Performance tests in javascript would add a lot of value to the project. If that's your forte, don't be shy.

**Provide feedback:** If you have a good suggestion, a useful use case, or just want to share your experience, don't hesitate to get involved.

Without your contributions and the contributions of the community, this would be just another half-baked CSV to add to the pile of literally thousands of broken/incomplete implementations. The quality of projects like these is a direct result of a greater community that is willing to suggest improvements and test the code.
